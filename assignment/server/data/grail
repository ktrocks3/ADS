Monty Python and the Holy Grail


Preface


The Production


Monty Python and the Holy Grail was the first real
feature film made by Monty Python’s Flying Circus
(they had previously released the compilation And Now
for Something Completely Different). It used a script
then recently discovered in a trunk in the attic of Mabel
Breckinstrop-Smythe of Manchester, England, written
by the great early 20th-century Welsh playwright
Montague Python.

The Holy Grail was filmed on location in England in
1974 on a shoestring budget. It was directed by Terry
Gilliam—who directed the MPEG BBC TV series—and


Terry Jones and was released in 1975 to quickly gain a
cult following around the world.

Terry Gilliam also created the memorable animation
sequences for the series and for this film. His role as the
faithful Patsy won him his long-awaited Nobel Peace
Prize.

Graham Chapman, the beloved Arthur of this film (and
Brian of Life of Brian) passed away in 1989 of throat
cancer; he was 48. He was a trained medical doctor (no
shit!).


The Author


While Sergeant Major Montague Penfold Python
stands among the greatest writers in the history of
English-language literature, and while he is the avowed
master of the absurdist school of comedy, and while he
was a genuine war hero and ace fighter pilot, little more
than these simple facts is known about him.

So little of Python’s life before or after WWI is
documented, and so few of his original manuscripts
survive, that his authorship—indeed, his very
existence—^has occasionally been called into question.

Some “scholars” claim him to be merely a


pseudonym of Samuel Beckett, or else attribute his
works to James Joyce, Joseph Conrad, or even Kng
George V, himself

This last suggestion is pure poppycock,
considering all the anti-monarchical, though eminently
patriotic, jokes found in Python’s works—although it
would explain the sudden cessation of material at about
the time of the king’s death. The idea of a king secretly
poking fun at himself is quite appealing to many, but
surely fantasy.


The Text


Partially owing to Python’s general obscurity, the
text of The Holy Grail presents a complicated problem.
The Eirst Quarto version of 1921 is classified by most
Pythonian scholars as a “Bad Quarto.” The parts and
lines seem to have been “reported” by one of the actors
from memory as best he could manage. This resulted in
some very garbled passages and certain speeches given
very short shrift.

Yet, Quarto I has many readings that are better than
those that appear in later texts, and also contains
detailed stage directions not found in later printings.
We include the stage directions because of the light
they throw on the production of the work in Python’s
own lifetime.

The Second Quarto of 1929 was supposedly printed
from a film set copy of the script. One would assume
that it represents the “authorized version,” although
anyone familiar with the practices of actors and directors
of any period knows that the writer’s text is often altered


and scribbled over.

Therefore, we have used Quarto II as the
foundation of our text, but we have imported readings
from the Eirst Quarto, the Eolio, and occasionally from
the other early Quartos when they seemed to correct
obviously poorly-preserved passages.

A Third Quarto of 1933 was printed using Quarto II.
The Eolio version of 1934 (with engravings) and an
undated Eourth Quarto follow the text of the Third
Quarto. Yet all of these introduce some different—
occasionally better, occasionally worse—readings that
make them all less than faultless.

The best that a modern editor can do is to compare
the early versions, puzzle out the odd pieces, and
choose the readings that best fit together, then make up
a cockamamie story about how he found a pristine
manuscript in the author’s own hand in a trunk in some
old maid’s attic in Manchester.

2s,-

The original (real) script, which purports to be “FINAL DRAFT 20.3.74,” reads “England AD 787.” Incidentally, the date
should iho'fj the “A.D.” first because A.D. stands for Anno Domini, ‘In the Year of Our Lord...’ and ‘932 in the Year of
Our Lord’ doesn’t make much sense. On the other hand, ‘B.C.’, standing for ‘Before Christ’ should come after the year.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail


[The scene is a foggy landscape, cold and bleak,^ penetrated by the clip clop of a horse’s hooves.®]

[Enter ARTHUR and faithful manservant and horse PATSY, a grubby little bastard carrying a huge pack and
clapping together two halves of a coconut. Enter a castle.]

ARTHUR: [halting] Whoa there!

[PATSY halts, with a final clop-clop]

ENGLISH GUARD #1: [atop wall] Halt! Who goes there?

ARTHUR: It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot, king of the Britons, defeator of the
Saxons, sovereign of all England!’

GUARD #1: Pull the other one!

ARTHUR: I am. And this my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of
knights who will join me in my court of Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.

GUARD #1: What, ridden on a horse?

ARTHUR: Yes!

GUARD #1: You’re using coconuts!

ARTHUR: What?

GUARD #1: You’ve got two empty halves of coconut and you’re bangin’ ’em together.

ARTHUR: So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia,
through—*

-

This is the middle of the Dark Ages, that early part of the Middle Ages when no one knew anything except for the
Christian monks who hid themselves away in fortified monasteries and sat on their big, fat Latin texts. Ethelstan is king
of Wessex (southern England today). It is unknown who is king of Mercia (western England), but the Danes (Germanic
Vikings) rule (more or less) the Danelaw (northern and eastern England) (source: The Anchor Atlas of World History,
Volume I).

5 Or at least its bleakness makes it seem cold, but the film was shot in England, where it is usually cold, so it isn’t
unreasonable to assume that it was, at the time of the shooting, indeed quite cold.

^ Well, they’re not actually horse’s hooves, as we’ll see in a moment, but they sound like them, which is quite evocative;
besides most horse-hoof sounds you hear in movies are actually foleyed (the motion picture art of sound fakery) by two
halves of a coconut being clapped together—which, when you think about it, is quite ironic, for the coconut halves that
Patsy is banging together were almost certainly themselves foleyed by a foley artist clapping two halves of a coconut
together. Isn’t life strange?

^ The distinction between ‘king of the Britons’ and ‘sovereign of aU England’ is a very clear one that Python is overlooking.
The Britons were a Celtic tribe occupying western Europe and the British Isles many many years before the Angles,
Saxons, and Jutes—all Germanic tribes—invaded in the 5th century. They drove the Britons into Wales to establish the
kingdom of England—^which means, of course, ‘land of the Angles.’ The king of England is, naturally, English, which is
to say Anglo-Saxon. The two are fundamentally at odds. Also, since the Saxons took over, it stands to reason that they
were not defeated. Hence, Arthur cannot be ‘defeator of the Saxons’ except in the most transitory way (It is said, for
instance, that he won the day at the Battle of Camden, but whoop-te-do; you never heard of the Battle of Camden, did
you?). The first king of all England was Edgar, crowned in 957, although Alfred the Great (crowned in 871) is generally
considered the first king of England (though it’s a bit like being president of Vichy France, if you ask me—it’s an occupied
territory filled with unfriendly subjects who don’t speak your language).

® So if Mercia is a kingdom, it must have a king, tight? So how can Arthur be ‘sovereign of all England’ if he is riding
through parts of England that are kingdoms? The answer is that, in those antique days, the concept of ‘king’ was still
getting worked out. A king was someone who had complete control over their land because he had conquered it; earls (or
‘thanes’) owed their title to their king because he gave it to them. Now if, through some sort of pigs-for-hostages deal,
one king came to owe some other king a few favors, he took an oath of fealty (which basically said, “I’ll come a-rushin’ to
your aid if n you’re attacked iljou’llzovci& a-rushin’ to ny aid if n I’m attacked.”). Then, one king would be king of another
king. This happened so often that it became so confusing that everyone decided there could be only one king. So a
Franco-Viking duke waded across the English Channel from Normandy, killed them all, and gave himself a big fat
promotion to King of England (although it’s a bit like being president of Vichy France, if you ask me—wait, didn’t I just
say that?).



Monty Python and the Holy Grail


GUARD #1: Where’d you get the coconut?

ARTHUR: We found them.

GUARD #1: Found them? In Mercia? The coconut’s frop/ca/!

ARTHUR: What do you mean?

GUARD #1: Well, this is a temperate zone.

ARTHUR: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin^ or the plumber may seek warmer climes in
winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.

GUARD #1: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate!

ARTHUR: Not at all, they could be carried.

GUARD #1: What? A swallow carrying a coconut!

ARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!

GUARD #1: It’s not a question of where i’ grips it! It’s a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could
not carry a one pound coconut.

ARTHUR: Well, it doesn’t matter. Will you go and tell your master that
Arthur from the court of Camelot is here.

GUARD #1: Listen, in order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow
needs to beat its wings for’y-three times every second, right?

ARTHUR: [impatient] Please!

GUARD #1: Am I right?

ARTHUR: I’m not interested!

[Enter GUARD #2 atop the castle wall]

GUARD #2: [to GUARD #1] It could be carried by an African swallow!

GUARD #1: [to GUARD #2] Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow. That’s my point.
GUARD #2: Oh, yeah, I agree with that...

ARTHUR: Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!

GUARD #1: But then, of course, African swallows are non-migra’ory.

GUARD #2: Oh, yeah...

GUARD #1: So they couldn’t bring a coconut back anyway...

[Exit ARTHUR and PATSY, clop-clopping their way off in disgust.]

GUARD #2: Wait a minute. Supposing two swallows carried it together?

GUARD #1: No, they’d have to have it on a line.

GUARD #2: Well, simple! They’d just use a strand o’ creeper!

GUARD #1: What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?

GUARD #2: Well, why not?*”

2s,-

5 Actually, martins are swallows; they are the largest members of the swallow family.

Swallows are quite small birds, strong flyers famous for their migratory patterns. They are not classed according to
habitat, however, because they migrate such vast distances. Therefore, there is no difference between a European swallow
and an African swallow, but rather between, say, a barn swallow and a cliff swallow. All known species of swallow being
quite small and having weak talons suited only to perching, none of them could carry a coconut and certainly could not
grip it by the husk. Also, if swallows had to beat their wings 43 times a second, they would have to eat about 6 pounds
of insects every day. These are champion migrators, remember, and thus extremely efficient flyers; Python seems to
confuse swallows with hummingbirds, which are New World birds and do not migrate. Finally, the idea of two swallows
working in consort to carry a coconut from some tropical island to Europe on a line between them held under the dorsal
guiding feathers is naturally totally preposterous because swallows chafe very easily (source: World Book Encyclopedia [except
that last part]).

Scene 2.—The Corpse Collector

[The scene is a medieval English village in the grips of a terrible plague. There is muck and filth littering the
streets, people fighting in the gutter, a plague victim coughing up his last meal, and wailing in the background."]

[Enter a corpse cart filled with corpses, pulled and pushed by carters. Enter a CORPSE COLLECTOR, banging an
iron triangle with a big wooden spoon.]

CORPSE COLLECTOR: [chanting] Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

[A villager throws a corpse on the heaping cart.]

Nine pence.

[The villager pays him.]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!'^

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[clang]

Bring out your dead!

[Enter CUSTOMER, carrying a DEAD PERSON over his shoulder.]

CUSTOMER: Here’s one.

CORPSE COLLECTOR: Nine pence.

DEAD PERSON: [weakly] I’m not dead!

CORPSE COLLECTOR: What?

CUSTOMER: Nothing. Here’s your nine pence, [hands the CORPSE COLLECTOR money]

DEAD PERSON: I’m not dead!

-

The curious thing about this scene is that the plagues of medieval Europe didn’t appear until the mid-fourteenth century,
hundreds of years after the supposed setting of the film. The fact that they caused horrendous amounts of suffering and
death and produced some of the most bizarre examples of human behavior ever recorded is all well and good as the
source for some gallows humor, but—uh...now, wait, I’ve forgotten what point I was going to make.

Irritating, isn’t it?

CORPSE COLLECTOR: Here, he says he’s not dead!

CUSTOMER: Yes he is.

DEAD PERSON: Tmnot!

CORPSE COLLECTOR: He isn’t.*^

CUSTOMER: Well, he will be soon. He’s very ill.

DEAD PERSON: I’m getting better!

CUSTOMER: [to DEAD PERSON] No, you’re not. You’ll be stone dead in a moment.

CORPSE COLLECTOR: Oh, I can’t take him like that. It’s against regulations.

DEAD PERSON: I don’t want to go in the cart!

CUSTOMER: Oh, don’t be such a baby.

CORPSE COLLECTOR: I can’t take him...

DEAD PERSON: I feel fine!

CUSTOMER: [to CORPSE COLLECTOR] Oh, do us a favor...

CORPSE COLLECTOR: I can’t.

CUSTOMER: Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes? He won’t be long.

CORPSE COLLECTOR: Naaah, I got to go on to the Robinsons’. They’ve lost nine today.

CUSTOMER: Well, when is your next round?

CORPSE COLLECTOR: Thursday.

DEAD PERSON: I think I’ll go for a walk!

CUSTOMER: [to DEAD PERSON] You’re not fooling anyone, y’know. [To CORPSE COLLECTOR] Look, isn’t there
something you can do?

DEAD PERSON: I feel happy... I feel happy!

[The CUSTOMER looks the other way as the CORPSE COLLECTOR whops the DEAD PERSON on the head
with his spoon.]

CUSTOMER: Ah, thanks very much.

CORPSE COLLECTOR: Not at all. See you on Thursday.

CUSTOMER: [dumping DEAD PERSON on top of heaping cart] Right.

[Enter ARTHUR and PATSY, clop-clopping their way through the village.]

CUSTOMER: Who’s that then?

CORPSE COLLECTOR: I don’t know. Must be a king.

CUSTOMER: Why?

CORPSE COLLECTOR: He hasn’t got shit all over him.


-

'3 Being mistaken for dead was a real problem before modern medicine. It wasn’t uncommon for people in shock or a
coma to be dumped in a hole and covered over, resulting in more than a few good ‘risen from the grave’ tales. Some
wealthy people in Victorian England and America bought special caskets with cords that ran through a pipe to a beU on
the surface. The fact that it would take hours to dig someone out even after they rang the beU and even after the terrified
listeners got up the nerve to do so apparendy did not occur to the purchasers.

This is a subtle bit of social commentary', paving the way for scene 3, which is a blatant bit of social commentary.
Remember that Britain still has a monarch who wields a good deal of influence, and a prime minister who is elected by
the parliament, not the people, and who is said to serve “at the leisure of Her Majesty, the Queen” and whose seal is
required to dissolve parliament before new elections can begin. That’s dissolve parliament, not adjourn the way the US
Congress adjourns, but actually technically dissolve the elected government until the next parliament convenes.

Scene 3.—Artetur and the Anarcho-Syndicalist Seres



[The scene is an idyllic English countryside, grubby peasants scraping a meager living out the harsh rocky soil
with their bare hands. A few serfs here and there carry what pathetic foodstuffs they have gathered up the road
toward some castle or other.]

[Enter ARTHUR and PATSY, on the road toward the castle. Enter DENNIS, presumably a serf, pulling an empty
cart in the same direction.]

ARTHUR: Old woman!

DENNIS: Manl

ARTHUR: Man, sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?

DENNIS: I’m thirty-seven.

ARTHUR: What?

DENNIS: I’m thirty-seven. I’mnoto/ii!'^

ARTHUR: Well, I can’t just call you ‘Man.’

DENNIS: Well, you could say ‘Dennis.’

ARTHUR: Well, I didn’t know you were called ‘Dennis.’

DENNIS: Well, you didn’t bother to find out, did you?

ARTHUR: I did say sorry about the ‘old woman,’ but from the
behind you looked—

DENNIS: What I object to is you automatically treat me like an inferior!

ARTHUR: Well, I am king...

DENNIS: Oh king, eh? Very nice, [stops, as do ARTHUR and PATSY] An’how’d you get that, eh? 'Ry exploitin’
the workers, by ’ angin’ on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic an’ social differences in
our society! If there’s ever going to be any progress—

[Enter WOMAN, scrambling up the slope to the road on her hands and knees.'*’]

WOMAN SERF: Dennis, there’s some lovely filth down here— Oh... [to ARTHUR, with respect] How d’you do?
ARTHUR: [To WOMAN] How do you do, good lady. I am Arthur, king of the Britons. Whose castle is that?

[DENNIS descends to the filth, kneels, and begins piling it up.'’]

WOMAN: King of the who?

ARTHUR: The Britons.

WOMAN: Who are the Britons?


ARTHUR: Well, we all are. We’re all Britons and I am your king.

WOMAN: I didn’t know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective.

DENNIS: [To WOMAN] You’re foolin’ yourself. We’re living in a dictatorship, a self-perpetuating autocracy in
which the working classes—

WOMAN: [To DENNIS, piling filth up also] Oh, there you go, bringing class into it again.

DENNIS: That’s what it’s all about! If only people would—


-

'5 Actually, all things considered, 37 was old for the Dark Ages, medicine being what it was and all, especially for a serf like
Dennis. In fact, most knights were mere beardless youths between 16 and 19V2.

Now this is an actual woman, but not really. In the great Shakespearean (not to mention Pythonian) tradition of theater,
she’s being played by a man. In the Elizabethan age, when Shakespeare was writing, it was unseemly for anyone to be an
actor, let alone a woman, so they had to use young boys to play the parts of women—a fact that Shakespeare capitalized
on himself for more than one joke (although it must have made his production of Romeo and Juliet a bit queer).

Do you think these people eat this mud? Or do they maybe collect it, as in “Have a look at my filth collection, Edgar; I
have some choice dirt clods from the west end”?


12







Monty Python and the Holy Grail


ARTHUR: [To both] Please, please good people. I am in haste. Who lives in that castle?

WOMAN: [To ARTHUR] No one lives there.

ARTHUR: Then who is your lord?

WOMAN: We don’t have a lord.

ARTHUR: What?

DENNIS: [To ARTHUR, ceasing his muck-piling] I told you. We’re an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in
turns to act as a sort of executive-officer-for-the-week.'*

ARTHUR: [To DENNIS] Yes.

DENNIS: But all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting.

ARTHUR: [impatient] Yes, I see.

DENNIS: By a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs—

ARTHUR: Be quiet!

DENNIS: —but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major—

ARTHUR: Be quiet! I order you to be quiet!

WOMAN: [To DENNIS] Order, eh? Who does he think he is?

[DENNIS goes back to muck-piling.]

ARTHUR: [To WOMAN] I am your Ung!

WOMAN: [To ARTHUR, stopping her muck-piling] Well, /didn’t vote for you.

ARTHUR: You don’t vote for kings.

WOMAN: Well, ’ow did you become king then? [goes back to muck-piling]

ARTHUR: [Staring off into the distance] The Lady of the Lake [angels sing], her arm clad in the purest, shimmering
samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry
Excalibur [singing stops]. That is why I am your king!'^

DENNIS: [Ceasing his muck-piling again] Listen. Strange women lyin’ in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a
system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical
aquatic ceremony.

-

I don’t want to get too nit-picky, here, but Dennis did not in fact already say that he and his companions lived in an
anarcho-syndicalist commune. Quite to the contrary, as a matter of fact, he said that they lived in a dictatorship, while the
woman said she thought they lived in an autonomous collective, also a far cry from an anarcho-syndicalist commune,
which is a utopian state in which the workers own and manage their industries without need of laws or leaders (source:
Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary). Moreover, in remarking earlier that they live in a ‘self-perpetuating autocracy,’ Dennis
clearly admitted to living in an absolute monarchy (where a king has total, unlimited power based on divine right), which
means he has a king. However, the Dark Ages—and well into the Middle Ages—European states were in fact feudal
monarchies, in which the king had powers determined in part by the commitments he could exact from his barons, and
they from their lords—based, ultimately, on how much plunder the king could lead his (or, rather, their) armies to.
England, in fact, never really had an absolute monarchy (as evidenced by the fact that Charles I was beheaded when he got
too big for his breeches {and Nixon thought that talk of impeachment tough!}!)!

Strictly speaking. Python is mucking about with the legend here. According to Sir Thomas Malory (d.l471)—England’s
traditional authority on the Round Table—Arthur drew the king-prover sword from the stone and anvil (“ExcaHbur” is
Latin for “freed from the stone,” but Malory does not give a name to it quite yet) to prove he was “rightwys kyge borne
of all Englond.” This sword he broke in battle against King PeUinore (the knight of the questing beast), who would have
slain him if not for Merlin. Merlin then took Arthur to the Lady of the Lake, who traded him the sword held in the hand
clad in white samite for a favor-to-be-named-later (note that the hand holding the sword was not hers). This second
sword Malory later identifies—when the Lady of the Lake comes to ask her favor—as (get this) “Excakbir, that ys as
muche to sey as Kutte Stele.” John Boorman solved the problem of the two swords in his film Excaliburhy having
Arthur draw Excalibur from the stone, subsequently break it in battle with Eancelot, and then give it to the Lady of the
Lake to fix\ This is as good an explanation as any, really, because it’s hard to imagine King Arthur going through aU
those adventures with a sword called Exmarkber (“freed from the water”). Now back to our story.

Scene 4.—Arthur and the Black Knight of the Bridge

[The scene is a marvelous English forest, full of great oaks, shot through with late-afternoon light, shimmering
among the leaves and filtering through the great canopy to the forest floor below. Enter ARTHUR and PATSY, clop¬
clopping their way along a forest path toward a bridge.]

[Cut to the BLACK KNIGHT and a SECOND KNIGHT, battling with claymores on the road before the bridge.
ARTHUR and PATSY halt to watch. The battle goes back and forth with great ferocity and tremendous grunting, the
BLACK KNIGHT felling the SECOND KNIGHT and nearly skewering him, then kicking the poor chap in the codpiece.
The SECOND KNIGHT recovers quickly and thumps the BLACK KNIGHT so solidly with his fists that the BLACK
KNIGHT falls.]

[The SECOND KNIGHT takes up his flail and swings mightily, but the BLACK KNIGHT dodges the blow,
catches the SECOND KNIGHT’s arm and throws him over. The SECOND KNIGHT rolls to his feet and raises his flail
for another strike, but the BLACK KNIGHT snatches up his sword in time to block the blow. The SECOND KNIGHT
is thrown over again and the two break.]

[The BLACK KNIGHT turns to find the SECOND KNIGHT charging madly with a great cry, his shining battle-ax
held high. But the BLACK KNIGHT heaves his two-handed sword, piercing the SECOND KNIGHT through the
eyelet of his visor. Blood spurts terrifically. The SECOND KNIGHT collapses.]

[ARTHUR gives PATSY a knowing nod. The BLACK KNIGHT steps on the SECOND KNIGHT’s head and
slides the claymore out of the corpse. He takes up his post before the bridge, leaning majestically on his great sword.
ARTHUR approaches.]

ARTHUR: You fight with the strength of many men, sir knight.

[pause]

I am Arthur, king of the Britons.

[pause]


-

Note how Dennis has used the technique of reductio ad absurdumto prove Arthur’s reasoning is fundamentally flawed; by
taking the argument to its logical extreme, utilizing the Rule of Three (which states: “Things are always funnier in threes”),
and thereby reducing it to absurdity, he shows that it cannot stand to reason. This is accomplished by exaggerating the
ridiculous aspects of the argument in three steps, each siUier than—but not so far from—the last.

[The two fight. ARTHUR draws and the two engage in tremendous combat, ARTHUR wielding Excalibur easily
and with grace. The BLACK KNIGHT grunts and shouts as his every blow is blocked, dodged, or parried. ARTHUR
clubs the BLACK KNIGHT on the helm with the pommel of Excalibur, giving a resounding dong. PATSY grins.]

[The battle continues as before. Suddenly, ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT’s left arm off The wound
bleeds profusely, spattering blood on the ground as the BLACK KNIGHT stares at it dumbly.]

ARTHUR: Now stand aside, worthy adversary.

BLACK KNIGHT: ’Tis but a scratch.

ARTHUR: Ascratch!? Your arm’s off!

ARTHUR: [pointing] Well, what’s that then?

BLACK KNIGHT: [Looks at the arm] I’ve hurt worse.

ARTHUR: You liar!

BLACK KNIGHT: Come on, you pansy! Hah!

[The fight resumes, ARTHUR defending himself lazily. Then, the
BLACK KNIGHT charges. ARTHUR steps aside and chops the BLACK
KNIGHT’S sword arm off. The BLACK KNIGHT halts, blood spattering the
ground from the fresh wound.]

ARTHUR: Victory is mine! [kneeling] We thank thee Lord, that in thy

BLACK KNIGHT: [kicking ARTHUR in the head and knocking him down] Hah! Come on then.

ARTHUR: What!?



2' The mysterious Black Knight is a recurring figure in Arthurian tales. It seems that taking up a shield painted black with
no other markings was a common way of going incognito. After all, the whole reason for a coat of arms in the first place
was so that you could be recognized without having to take off your helmet. Malory makes use of the ‘mistaken identity’
plot twist in a number of tales, with knights finding shields, knights trading shields on purpose or accidentally, knights
having to take up a different shield to go unrecognized, etc. But anyway, when Arthur broke Excalibur in battle with
PeUinore, it was in just such a situation as this, wherein Pelhnore had set his pavilion up beside a fountain and challenged
any knight who passed by to battle him. Similarly, when Bakn—the Knight-with-the-two-swords—encountered his
brother Balan, who had recendy become the Red Knight (whoever slays the Red Knight, keeper of the island, was cursed
to become the Red Knight), he carried a borrowed shield. The two fought and slew one another, Balin striking with a
cursed sword (‘Arondight,’ which could only be drawn by the greatest living knight and doomed the bearer to slay the
man he most loved in aU the world). Lancelot later claimed the sword when he rose to greatness (he was just a kid when
Bakn died).

-

Note how Python uses the Black Knight to comment on the grim bravado of fighting men the world over, their funereal
humor, and their absolute dedication to getting killed. Python has chosen the figure of the Green Knight of Arthurian
legend (a character from folklore not mentioned by Malory) to model the Black Knight. The Green Knight, a figure itself
probably derived from a Celtic nature god who challenged young heroes to mortal combat, challenged Gawain in the
Middle English poem “Sir Gawain and the Green Knight” to exchange blows. Gawain chose to strike at the neck,
chopping off the giant’s head, which it then picked up and reattached. The Green Knight is therefore a symbol of
nature’s unconquerability. Python plays with that notion in the figure of the Black Knight, making him a symbol of
humanity’s desire for unconquerability. The Black Knight also includes elements of Tithonus, an ancient Greek figure of
tragedy. He was loved by an immortal nymph who convinced the gods to grant him immortality, but forgot to ask for
etetmA-jouth, thereby condemning her lover to ever-increasing frailties of age. Likewise, the Black Knight may indeed be as
invincible as he claims, yet not be invulnerable, and so may be (comically) doomed to eternal stumphood. Lesson over.
Now back to the film.

-

The (real) original script for the film called for a series of set pieces mixed into a montage to introduce the knights. For
whatever reason, this idea was abandoned in favor of the ‘Book of the Film’ idea. The original idea is probably superior
(although it introduces odd concepts, such as Lancelot having a wife and children). We (by which we mean the editorial
‘we,’ meaning ‘I’) present the text for your scholarly perusal:

VOICE OVER

And so King Arthur gathered his knights together ... bringing from all the corners of the kingdom the
strongest and bravest in the land ... To sit at The Round Table ...

Under this voice over we have a montage of shots of ARTHUR recruiting his Knights:

1. ARTHUR, PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE riding through hillside.

2. MIX TO: A castle. LONG SHOT of SIR GAWAIN standing outside and ARTHUR'S group
approaching and shaking hands perhaps.

3. MIX TO the group now plus SIR GAWAIN and PAGE (who is weighted down by an enormous
quantity of luggage) riding down by a stream and approaching SIR HECTOR. ARTHUR dubs him.

4. MIX TO the group (now plus HECTOR and PAGE) approaching some group of buildings or
whatever. In the distance SIR ROBIN is being taught the lute by one of his MUSICIANS. ARTHUR
calls and SIR ROBIN immediately reacts and hands the lute to his MUSICIAN and comes to join
ARTHUR & CO.

5. MIX TO SIR GALAHAD surrounded by chickens. He is wearing a carpenters apron over his
immaculate armor and is finishing off a hen-house. We see the group approach and he throws off the
apron and puts down the hen-house and goes to join them.

6. MIX TO the group riding along again.

7. MIX TO SIR LAUNCELOT handing a BABY to his WIFE (who has several other CHILDREN
hanging about) and he strides off to join ARTHUR, leaving his casde, WIFE and CHILDREN. The
casde (Eilean Donan) has washing hanging outside it. A real family casde. There are at least six kids.

8. MIX TO the complete group, i.e. ARTHUR and PATSY, BEDEVERE and PAGE, GAWAIN and
PAGE, HECTOR and PAGE, GALAHAD and PAGE, SIR ROBIN and six MUSICIANS,
LAUNCELOT and PAGE.

2'* Now, I really do hate to seem picky, but no source, French, English, or German, ever mentions a “Sir Robin.” I mean,
realiy. Is Python confusing the Arthur legend with the Robin Hood legend? Or is Python merely trying to avoid picking
on a knight of the Round Table to make fun of as a coward? There were plenty of knights they could have used if they
wanted to. Malory mentions practically all one hundred and forty that he says followed Arthur. Counting just the ones
Malory devotes whole chapters to, there were Gareth of Orkney (brother to Gawain, who himself is only mentioned near
the end of the film); Perdval; Tristram; Lamorak; Palomides; Bakn and Balan (twin brothers, the former of whom slew
the Lady of the Lake); Tor; Pelknore; Accolon; Ywain and Marhalt; and the Hungarian, Sir Urry the Wounded Knight
(seriously). And if P}'thon wanted a coward, there was Sir Garlon the Invisible Knight; Sir Bruce Sans Pite; Kay the
Seneschal, Arthur’s foster brother (and son of Ector, who is also merely mentioned at the end of the film); and Mordred,

[The scene is another medieval English village, this one in slightly better condition that the one in scene 2. Enter

about, dragging a bound woman—with a carrot tied to cover her nose, and a funnel on her head—to a platform.

Enter BEDEVERE upon the platform, a dove in one hand, a coconut in the other, a string tied between them. He lets

the dove go.^’]

VILLAGER#2: She looks like one!

CROWD: Yeah! She looks like one! Yeah! Yeah!

BEDEVERE: Bring her forward.

2s,-

Arthur’s son by his half-sister Morgause (not his other half-sister Morgan La Fay, who doesn’t rate much more than
allusion in the film, but who could have been a real asset to the film {wink, wink}); and Agravaine, son of Morgause and
brother of Gawain (among others), who coveted Guenevere (who also doesn’t rate squat in this film, but who also could
have been very titillating {nudge, nudge}) and sought with his half-brother Mordred to catch her and Lancelot in bed
together so they could kill the great knight unarmed. Is this getting a little thick? It’s just that this manuscript wouldn’t
seem like a genuine Knights of the Round Table story without a big list of knights and their relationships. Sorry. Sorry,
eveiyfiody.

The (real) script notes that these fellows are a reference to flagellants (that’s flagellants, not flatulence) in The Seventh Seal, a
1957 Ingmar Bergman film that no one ever saw about a knight who plays chess with Death in an attempt to answer his
metaphysical questions before Death takes him wandering across the country-side spreading the plague.

Medieval ascetics really were this weird, if not weirder. They often practiced bizarre and dangerous methods of seeking
perfection, such as fasting, self-mutilation by scourge (a barbed cat-o’-nine tails), wandering endlessly without stopping,
and watermelon-swallowing. Okay, I made that last one up.

22 This is a clever callback to the opening scene, in case you hadn’t noticed, although why he is using a dove instead of a
swallow is baffling. What follows, by the way, is a precious bit of farce, in which the whole medieval approach to science is
parodied. Remember that this was a time in which matters of law were settled with jousts, and witches and heretics were
tested for truth by forcing them to grab red-hot irons. Recall that the pope forced Galileo to take back that siUy tripe
about the earth moving around the sun, that some alchemists spent their entire lives trying to turn lead into gold, and that
for a thousand jears people believed that heavy things fell faster than light things just because Aristotle said so in his
Physics. The Vatican recanted its position on Galileo’s case only in 1992, by the way.

25 This is clearly a comment on the myopia of the modern scientific community.

It is Bedevere who, when Arthur is mortally-wounded, is instructed to take Excalibur—or Exmarliber if you like—to a
nearby lake and heave it in. But twice Bedevere can’t bring himself to chuck such a lovely piece of killing equipment into a
froggy English pond until Arthur practically threatens to kill him even though he’s dying himself. When Bedevere does
finally lob the longsword into the lake, a hand and arm clad in the purest shimmering samite thrusts up and snatches it
out of the air; thus the sword is returned to the water whence it came—quite a pretty scene, but not one included in this
film, probably only because they didn’t have the budget for scuba gear for the Lady of the Lake.

Clap-trap like this really was believed in the Middle Ages. Scientific discovery by controlled experimentation was totally
unheard of until the Renaissance. Ever^Body pretty much just took the word of whomever shouted the loudest that they
knew the most. Real science, as differentiated from alchemy and astrology, was practically invented by Galileo, if you ask
me.

Unfortunately, even though this is the only real song we get in the film, it is really quite pathetic. Python produced vastly
better melodies in the TV series and vaMP’s Meaning ofl^ife. Why they stumbled here is beyond me. Oh sure, the bit has
charm, and the song is even a little catchy, but the whole scene really has the look and feel of a postscript. Oh well, at least
it mentions Spam®. PS: Spam® means so much to the British because Americans sent planeloads of it England during
World War II, when meat was so scarce. Hormel’s canned meat holds a special place in their hearts.

ARTHUR: [rising, with KNIGHTS, but averting eyes] Sorry—

GOD: And don’t apologize! Every time I try to talk to someone it’s “sorry this” and “forgive me that” and “I’m not
worthy—” What are you doing now! ?

ARTHUR: I’m averting my eyes, O Lord.

GOD: Well, (fon’f. It’s like those miserable Psalms. They’re io depressing. Now knock it off!^^


Not to be judgmental, but the Psalms are quite depressing. Trust me. Proverbs is pretty cool though, and Revelations is
downright explosive.

ARTHUR: [looking up] Yes, Lord.

GOD: Right! Arthur, King of the Britons, you’re Knights of the Round Table shall
have a task to make them an example in these dark times.

ARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord!

GOD: ’Course it’s a good idea! Behold!

[angels singing, God replaced by Holy Grail]

Arthur, this is the Holy Grail. Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek
this Grail.

That is your purpose, Arthur: the Quest for the Holy Grail.

Scene 9.—The Quest for the Holy Grael


[Animated tmmpet flourishes, angels, Christ, more angels.]

[Screen title] The Quest for the Holy Grail

Scene 10.—Arthur at Castle Loimbard

[The scene is more of the monotonous English countryside.]

[Enter ARTHUR, KNIGHTS, and entourage. They cross a stream and arrive at a castle.]

ARTHUR: [To KNIGHTS] Halt!

[pathetic trumpet blast]

[To castle] Hallo!

[Enter castle.]

Hallo!

ERENCH GUARD: [Atop wall] Alio! Who iz it?

ARTHUR: [To GUARD] It is King Arthur, and these are the Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this?

GUARD: This is the castle of my master, Guy de Loimbard.

ARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest. If he will give us food

and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.

-

■’3 Now, according to tradition, the Grail Quest began on the night of the feast of Pentecost. Galahad had just come to
Camelot from the abbey where he was raised, sat in the Siege Perilous (the Seat of Danger, where no man but he-for-
whom-it-was-meant could sit, lest he should die), and became a knight of the Round Table. The Holy Grail floated into
the hall covered in white samite so that none could see it, passed through leaving meat and drink as each knight most
loved, and disappeared (the Grail was often associated with sustenance). It was Sir Gawain who—out of the blue—
declared he would leave the very next day to seek the Holy Grail. The other knights immediately agreed, but Arthur was
aghast. He knew the quest would sunder the fellowship of the Round Table (much the way that John Cleese’s decision
to mart}' Yoko Ono broke up the Python troupe). Also—perhaps I should have mentioned it earlier—but samite, if you
were wondering, is a rich silk fabric usually interwoven with very fine gold wire and held in high esteem in the Middle
Ages, particularly because aU silk had to come directly from the Orient, where silk worm cultivation was a jealously-
guarded secret for hundreds of years until someone smuggled some silkworm eggs out in a hollow cane—isn’t history
stupid? (source: Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable).

GUARD: Well, I’ll ask him, but I don’t think he’ll be very keen.... Uh, he’s already got one, you see?

ARTHUR: What?

GALLAHAD: [To ARTHUR in disbelief] He says they’ve already got one!

ARTHUR: Are you sure he’s got one?

GUARD: Oh, yes, it’s very nice-a. [To OTHER GUARDS] I told him we already got one.

OTHER GUARDS: [to themselves] Ppppfff. Heh, heh, heh.

ARTHUR: Well, um, can we come up and have a look?

GUARD: Oi course not\ You are English types-a!

ARTHUR: Well, what are you then?

GUARD: I’m French! Why do think I have this outraaageous accent, you silly king!?

GALLAHAD: [To GUARD] What are you doing in England?

GUARD: [To GALLAHAD] Mind your own business!

[pause]

ARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!

GUARD: [To ARTHUR] You don’t frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person.
I blow my nose on you, so-called Arthur-king, you and all your silly English kannnnniggets. Thppppt! [taps helmet
several times, makes antlers with hands, smacks lips]

GALLAHAD: [To himself] What a strange person.

ARTHUR: Now look here, my good ma—

GUARD: I don’t wanna talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough wiper! I fffart in your general
direction! Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries! [smacks lips again.]^'*

GALLAHAD: [To GUARD] Is there someone else up there we could talk to?

GUARD: No! Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a!

ARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance. I’ve been more than reasonable.

GUARD: [To OTHER GUARDS] Eetchez la vache [“Go get the cow”].

OTHER GUARD: Quoi? [“What?”]

GUARD: Eetchez la vache!

[OTHER GUARDS bring out cow, mooing]

ARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall—

[Suddenly, with a great ‘twong,’ the cow is catapulted over the castle wall at the KNIGHTS]

COW: [distressedly] Mooooooo!

ARTHUR: Jesus Christ!

[The cow lands with a thud upon Gallahad’s porter.]

ARTHUR: Right! Charge!

ALL: Charge!

-

Elderberries were sometimes used to make wine, therefore implying that Arthur’s father was an alcoholic. Actual statistics
on alcoholism in the Dark Ages are unavailable, but it’s likely that they were quite high, at least among the nobility, who
were the only ones who could afford wine, aside from the monks who made it. This is a bit of a trade-off, really, because
if you didn’t drink wine {or some other alcoholic beverage} aU the time and therefore become an alcoholic, you had to
drink water, which was usually putrid and thus killed you sooner than alcoholism ever could. Think of that next time
you’re raising the wrist.

-’5 The (real) script of the film included a litde joke here in which Bedevere says (of the deceased cow), “It hadn’t even been
milked.”

[A great deal of livestock, mostly live chickens, is dispensed over the castle walls at the KNIGHTS.]

GUARD: Ah, this one is for your mother. [More livestock] This one’s for your dad!

KNIGHTS: [fleeing] Run away! Runaway!

GUARD: Thpppt!

[The KNIGHTS take refuge in a ditch.]

LANCELOT: Fiends! I’ll tear them apart!

ARTHUR: No no, no.

BEDEVERE: Sir! I have a plan, sir.

[Cut to FRENCH GUARD atop wall. The sounds of sawing rise out of the forest, then a variety of thumps,
creaks, screeches, whirring, and clanks. Finally, a wheeled vehicle(?) comes rolling up to the castle, while the
GUARD stands dumfounded, straining to hear and thumping himself on the helmet imbecilically. The vehicle is a
giant wooden rabbit,^'’ with a red ribbon and sign that reads, “Pour votres amis Francais’’ (“For our French friends’’}.
A GUARD opens the castle gate and peeks out, then slips back in.]

OTHER GUARD: Ce lapin—lapin de boit. [This rabbit—a wooden rabbit.]

ANOTHER GUARD: Quoi? [What?]

[Several GUARDS peek out]

OTHER GUARD: Uncadeau. [A present.] A present! [Uncadeau!]

ANOTHER GUARD: Oh, un cadeau.

OTHER GUARD: Oui, oui. [Yes, yes.] Hurry! [Vite!]

ANOTHER GUARD: Quoi? [What?]

OTHER GUARD: Let’s go! [Allons-y!]

[GUARDS come out to push the rabbit through the castle gates]

[Cut to ARTHUR and KNIGHTS in ditch.]

ARTHUR: [To BEDEVERE] What happens now?

BEDEVERE: Well, now, uh, Lancelot, Gallahad, and I wait until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the
French by surprise. Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!

ARTHUR: Who leaps out?

BEDEVERE: [pointing] Uh, Lancelot, Gallahad, and I, uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh....

ARTHUR: [Putting head in hands, as do others] Oh....

BEDEVERE: Oh.... Um, 1-look, if we built this large wooden badger—

[ARTHUR whacks him on the back of the helm.]

[Suddenly, with at least as great a ‘twong’ as the cow made, the giant wooden rabbit is catapulted out of the
castle at our heroes.^’]

KNIGHTS: Runaway! Runaway! Runaway! Run away! [The rabbit comes crashing down on a terrified porter,
weighed down as he was with a huge pack and numerous provisions.]

GUARDS: Oh! Haw haw haw. Sacre bleu! [Holy cow!^*]


-

The rabbit, by the way, is not native to England and did not appear there until they were brought from Africa and
southern Europe (they are non-migratory, you know). We could delude ourselves into believing this to be a common
European hare but for the identification as a rabbit soon after by Bedevere himself.

The (real) script of the film included a callback to the not-funny-in-the-first-place “It’s only a model” joke.

Paraphrased; literally, this is ‘blue sanctity’ roughly meaning “heavens,” but ‘holy cow’ is funnier.

DIRECTOR: Action!

[screen title] A FAMOUS HISTORIAN

FAMOUS HISTORIAN: [gesturing eccentrically] Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King
Arthur. The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a
new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur,
having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. Now,
this is what they did—

[Just then there is the sound of hoofbeats. Curiously enough, these are probably real hoofbeats, because they
sound different from the clapping of coconut halves and because we immediately see...]

rows, rather orchard-like really."''*]

NARRATOR: So each of the knights went their separate ways."" Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of
Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.

[The scene is...wait, I already said that. Enter ROBIN, MINSTREL (playing a lute], and entourage (playing other
medieval instruments, such as pipes and tabor (a small drum)}.]

MINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, brought forth from Camelot.

He was not afraid to die. O! Brave Sir Robin.

He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.

Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!


-

The credits in the (real) script make a point of noting that this character is decidedly not supposed to be A.J.P. Taylor,
apparendy an attempt to avoid a lawsuit.

“•o One wonders if this was perhaps shot in a reforested area of England, so much of that nation’s magnificent oak forests
having been chopped down over the centuries. And for what? Firewood! Firewood and half-timber houses, which are
all well and good in themselves, but they use a hell of a lot of wood if you ask me. And furniture. Tons of oak furniture;
huge tables and chairs and beds and cabinetry and mantelpieces and such. Sure, oak is nice and there was a lot of it, but
pine is nice too—although it’s a softwood and doesn’t take stain as well, but it grows one hell of a lot faster.

Technically, this should be ‘each...went his separate way,’ to maintain parallelism.

He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp,

Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.

To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away.

And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!

[They pass a signpost that reads {also in triplicate} “BEWARE!!!’’

His head smashed in and his heart cut out.

And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged.

And his nostrils ripped and his bottom burned off.

And his penis split—

In place of this litde bit, the (real) script originally had a several more dead knights lying around and a bunch of (live)
maidens tied to a tree, one of whom replies to Robin’s cheery greetings with a sad “Bye.”

The (real) script included even more of this bickering here, including a callback to Dennis the Serfs “executive chairman of
the week” bit. Originally, Robin was shown dramatically more brave throughout the scene, even badgering the giant to
make a decision and such.

Cut to a tall, dark castle with a single lit window high in the wall, accompanied by angelic singing, suspended over
which is the glowing, unmistakably-beatific form of the Holy Grail. GALAHAD looks over his shoulder one last time,
a wolf howls, and the grail is gone, leaving the castle and its single inviting window. GALAHAD scrambles up the
slope and makes his way toward the castle.]

GALAHAD: [pounding on door] Open the door! Open the door! In the name of King Arthur, open the doo—

[The door squeaks open. Galahad throws himself inside. The door closes behind him. Enter ZOOT and

DINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! [to GALAHAD] She has been setting a light to our beacon, which, I just
remembered, is grail-shaped. It’s not the first time we’ve had this problem.

but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon: you must tie her down on a bed and spank her!

LANCELOT: Yes you were. You were in peril.

GALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and/ace the peril.

LANCELOT: No. It’s too perilous.

GALAHAD: Look, I do feel as a knight I should sample as much peril as I can.

LANCELOT: No, we’ve got to find the Holy Grail, [mshing him around the comer] Come on!

GALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?

-

And no quivering minion’s advance ought to be blocked, if you want my opinion.

Nudge, nudge.

There is, perhaps, no moment in the film more moving than this.

50 In the English legends, Galahad was the only knight to actually achieve the Grail, for he was the most pure and chaste of
all Arthur’s knights, so much so, in fact that he was, as Python would say, a right bote. It was Lancelot, Percival, Bors,
and Gawain who were the interesting knights of the Grail. Gawain failed outright, Lancelot only managed a peek at the
Grad, Bors succeeded in the quest but could not achieve the Grad because he had lost his virginity, and Percival just
managed to avoid breaking his vow of chastity but could not achieve the Grail either because he was so sorely tempted. It
is a combination of the stories of Percival and Bors that Python’s tale of Galahad is based on. The tale of Sir Bors
contains the tower fud of maidens who turn out to be fiends, whde the tale of Sir Percival contains the overwhelming
temptation and the thigh wound, but it is at the end of the story that Percival gets the thigh wound (a traditional
metaphor for castration) and he gives it to himself punishment for being tempted. It is Percival’s story (in the French
version) that also includes a group of maidens who attend the Grad in the castle of the Fisher King (a.k.a. the Wounded
King). These are known as the Grail Maidens (those clever scholars).

[Eurry claw hand turns page to reveal a photo of the beginning of the next scene opposite the words ‘Scene

24.’”]“

NARRATOR: [no longer reading] But they were still no nearer the Grail. Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere,
not more than a swallow’s flight away, had discovered something.

[pause]

Oh, that’s an unladen swallow’s flight, obviously. I mean, they were more than two laden swallow’s flights
away. Eour, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them. I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging—

UNIT OE MEDIEVAL INEANTRY ARRANGED IN A LINE ON A HILL: Get on with it!

NARRATOR: Oh, anyway, on to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which
Arthur discovers a vital clue, in which there aren’t any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling—wholp!


Scene 16.^*—Arthur, Bedevere, and the Old Man

[The scene is a ramshackle dry stone hut with a little plume of smoke rising out of it. Nearby stand PATSY and

another porter. Cut to the interior, where a deformed OLD MAN sits cackling by a crackling fire among a bird cage,

loose roofing, and other junk. ARTHUR and BEDEVERE sit with him.^®]

2s,-

5' It should be noted that if anybody needed saving from sexual temptation, it was Lancelot. Nobo^fy got more babes than
Lance, not even Arthur, and Arthur was almost as big on adultery as Guenevere. Mordred may have been Arthur’s son
by his half-sister Morgan La Fey, but Galahad was Lancelot’s son by Elaine, sister of Morgause and half-sister of Arthur.
And that’s aside from Lancelot’s long-term affair with Guenevere. And who knows what went on when Lancelot fled
Camelot and wandered England in madness...? Oh, there I go again.

52 The book says ‘saves.’

55 Yes, the spelling changes again. Perhaps the fellow we saw in the scene before was a different knight, kind of like Bakn
and Balan; similar men, but different enough to be important, yet it being important that they be confused.

5“* This is one of those milquetoast phrasings that really makes my skin crawl, things like ‘nearly put in possible danger’ and
‘could have a potential risk.’ The words temptation, danger, and risk have the notion of possibility built into them. It isn’t
necessary to water them down further with subjunctive tense and equivocal phrasing. It’s downright siUy! Oh yeah, that’s
what this is all about. Sorry.

55 The old man in this scene reappears in scene 29 and is referred to as “the old man from scene 24.” It should be noted
that, although this manuscript fails to number the scenes in such a way as that this line makes sense, the (real) script of the
film numbers this scene as scene 16, while scene 24 is actually (our) scene 22, “Lancelot 8, Swamp Castle 0.” Incidentally,
our scene 24 is “Arthur and the Knights of Ni, Take 2.”

55 This is too many footnotes for such a little scene, isn’t it? Be honest. I should cut down, shouldn’t I?

55 This is another callback to the opening scene, which is well on the way to becoming a running joke.

55 Python apparently numbered the scenes so that this was scene 24.

55’ This scene is typical of the Arthurian Romances. Hermits popped up everywhere to help or hinder the hero for no good
reason. I mean, when you think about it, if a person has decided to become a hermit for a living, you would think that
that meant he didn’t want to have anything to do with other people. But hermits in the Arthurian Cycles were gadding
about, bothering people, spouting prophesies like they were going out of style....

OLDMAN: Ah, hee he he ha!

ARTHUR: And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?

OLD MAN: Ha ha he he he he!

ARTHUR: Where does he live? Old man, where does he live?

OLD MAN: [rubbing hands together] He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered.

ARTHUR: And the Grail... The Grail is there?

OLD MAN: Very much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril“, which no man has ever crossed.
ARTHUR: But the Grail! Where is the Gra//.'.?

OLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.®'

ARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?

OLD MAN: [fading away] Hee hee ha ha....

[Suddenly, the shack is gone and ARTHUR and BEDEVERE sit before pile of smoldering leaves in the open
wilderness, bewildered. They stand.]

Scene 17.—Arthur and the Knights of Nf ^ Take 1

[A foggy wood. Enter ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and their porters, the slop-slop of their coconuts echoing eerily
off the trees. Snap goes a twig and ARTHUR spins to glimpse a tall, horned figure in the foggy shadows. Snap!
There’s another. He glances all about nervously. There are several figures dashing around! They’ve got us
surrounded! Oh God! NO!—Sorry. Sorry, I got a little carried away.]

[Enter the HEAD KNIGHT OE NI, a huge, antler-helmed man of grave countenance.®^]

HEAD KNIGHT OE NI: Nnni! [the Knights of the Round Table cringe]

OTHER KNIGHTS OE NI: [in background] Ni! Ni! Ni!

ARTHUR: Who are you?

HEAD KNIGHT: We are the Knights Who Say... Ni!

KNIGHTS OEM: Ni!

ARTHUR: No! Not the Knights Who Say Ni!

HEAD KNIGHT: The same!

BEDEVERE: [To ARTHUR] Who are they?

HEAD KNIGHT: We are the keepers of the sacred words: Ni, Peng, andNeuuwhom!®"'

KMGHTSOENI: Neuuwhom!

ARTHUR: [To BEDEVERE] Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!

HEAD KNIGHT: The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice!

ARTHUR: Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
KMGHTSOEM: Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!

-

There is that equivocal phrasing again. ‘Eternal perk’ would mean that the person suffers continuous risk of harm, as
opposed to continuous harm. ‘Gorge of Eternal Pain’ would have been a better name—I mean, if you wanted to be
clear. And it could be more specific, like the Gorge of Eternal Gout or the Gorge of Gastrointestinal Distress.

Now there’s a good, solid, unforgiving name!

'52 Python’s spelling, from the (real) script.

'53 The Head Knight of Ni can only possibly remind one of the legendary Celtic nature-figure, the Master of the Hunt, who
would race through the dark, misty forests of Britain with his pack of wild hounds, entrancing any who met them, forcing
them to join in their mad hunt, running recklessly through the wilderness till the break of dawn. Ooh, it just makes your
skin prickle, doesn’t it?

'5'* Python spells this two different ways in the (real) script; we chose a third way, just to be contrary.

FATHER: Father. I’m Father.

HERBERT: But Father, I don’t want any of that.

FATHER: [wandering to and fro] Listen, lad. I’ve built this kingdom up from nothing. When I started here, all there
was was swamp. All the kings said I was daft to build a castle in a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show ’em.
It sank into the swamp—so I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third one. That burned
down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. And that’s what your gonna get, lad: the
strongest castle in these islands.

HERBERT: But I don’t want any of that. I’d rather—

FATHER: Rather what?!

HERBERT: I’d rather...just...

GUARD #1: And you’ll come and get him.

GUARD #2: Hie!

'5'> Then apparendy her father is a Danish Viking chieftain, because it was the Viking hordes that owned the biggest parts of
the British Isles at that time. The Danelaw, as it was called, was essentially an independent nation on the northeast of
‘England,’ and not beholden to English kings at aU. In all likelihood, it was the existence of these people that forced Old
Saxon to meld with Old Norse to produce Old English, the precursor of our own language. The name ‘Lucky’ is,
however, of later Dutch origin (source: American Heritage Dictionary).

Say that three times fast.

'58 Syphilis?

'55'If Herbert is a prince, his father must logically be a king, light? Well, king of what? Mercia? Wessex? There were a lot of
petty kings around at that time, but not many kings of swamps. He sounds like he’s from lower London, if you ask me,
but London isn’t built on a swamp.

Scene 20.—Sir Launcelot Receives an Urgent Cry of Distress

[The scene is outside Swamp Castle, where Lancelot is passing by, leaping from stone to stone to cross a stream,

LAUNCELOT: Well taken, Concorde!

CONCORDE: Thank you, sir! Most kind.

LAUNCELOT: And again... [leaping] Over we go! Good. Steady! And now, the big one... [leaps] Ooof! Come on,
Concorde!

[Thwonk, HERBERT’S arrow hits CONCORDE in the chest]

CONCORDE: [keeling over] Message for you, sir.

whoeverfinds this note:^' I have been imprisoned by my father, who wishes me to marry against my will. Please,
please, please come and rescue me. I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle.” At last! A call, a cry of distress! This
could be the sign that leads us to the Holy Grail!’^ [To CONCORDE] Brave, brave Concorde! You shall not have
died in vain!

LAUNCELOT: [stopping him] No, no, sweet Concorde! Stay here! [rises] I will send help as soon as I have
accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular...[sighs]

Scene 21.—Sm Launcelot Assaults Swamp Castle

[Inside the Great Hall of Swamp Castle, handmaidens decorate the fat bride and braid her horse-like hair.
Wedding guests mingle near the fire. A hind is spitted. Minstrels play. Maidens dance a Morris dance.]

2s,-

These ninnies act as though a horse could leap from stone to stone to cross a stream. Horses are very strong swimmers
and can cross even good-sized rivers with a rider on their backs. It is patendy absurd that a horse might choose to go tip¬
toeing across rocks rather than just stamping its way through a pathetic little stream like the one in this scene, coconuts or
no coconuts! Thank you; I just needed to get that off my chest.

This should be, technicaUy-speaking, “To whomever finds this note...”

What logic is this? Since when do Holy Grails send out cries of distress? Only Launcelot would make this Achilles’ leap
of logic.

Now we get a callback to the corpse-collector scene. You see how this works? We’re building running jokes here.

Lancelot really was a complete savage when it came to knight-errantry, having literally picked up the role where Bakn the
Sauvage (a.k.a. the Knight-with-the-two-swords) left off, by taking up Balin’s cursed sword. He joined the underdog in
every fight he came upon, slew anybody who got in his way (including Gahetis and Gareth, who were guarding
Guenevere when Lancelot came to save her from being burned at the stake, which irked their brother Gawain to no end),
porked his courdy love (Queen Guenevere) in her chambers at Camelot, and screwed Elaine after he saved her (thereby
begetting Galahad). Lancelot’s problem was that idiom he’s on about. He was the perfect courtly knight, but the quest
for the Holy Grail required the perfect holy knight, and Lance just wasn’t up to it.

Scene 23.—Arthur and the Cynical Shrubber

[The scene is a medieval English village, presumably different from the ones we’ve seen before, but markedly
similar. There is the horrible sound of a cat screeching repeatedly, which is no wonder, because an OLD CRONE is
soon seen beating a cat against a post.’^]

[Enter ARTHUR, BEDEVERE, and their porters, clopping along the cobblestone street.^*]

ARTHUR: [halting] Old crone! Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery!

[dramatic chord]

CRONE: Who sent you?™

ARTHUR: The Knights Who Say Ni.

CRONE: [terrified] Agh! No! Never! We have no shrubberies here.

ARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say— We will say...‘ni’.

CRONE: [greatly pained] Agh! Do your worst!

ARTHUR: Very well! If you will not assist us voluntarily.... Ni!

CRONE: No! Never! No shmbberies!

ARTHUR: Ni!

BEDEVERE: Nu! Nu!

ARTHUR: [To BEDEVERE] No, no, no, no. It’s not that, it’s ‘ni’.

BEDEVERE: Nu!

ARTHUR: No, no—‘ni’. You’re not doing it properly.

BEDEVERE: Nu! Ni!

ARTHUR: That’s it, that’s it, you’ve got it.

ARTHUR and BEDEVERE: [To OLD CRONE] Ni! Ni!

[Enter ROGER THE SHRUBBER, atop an oxcart.]

ROGER: Are you saying ‘ni’ to that old woman?

ARTHUR: [To ROGER] Urn, yes.

-

Cats were, in fact, quite despised in medieval times, associated as they were with Satan and witchcraft. For hundreds of
years, cats were singled out for persecution and tortured and killed by the thousands, sometimes in great massacres. All
this almost certainly led to the huge infestations of rats and other rodents during the period, which undeniably produced
the proliferation of fleas and other pests, which in turn unquestionably contributed to the enormity of the plagues
Europe suffered during the same period. The ignorant, superstitious, kitty-hating bastards. They deserved it.

Well they’re not really clopping on the cobblestone street; they’re clopping two halves of a coconut together, but by now
you get the idea.

This is a precious bit of acting here that the crone gives us.


42



Monty Python and the Holy Grail


ROGER: [To himself] Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say ‘ni’ at will to old ladies. There is a
pestilence upon this land. Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under
considerable economic stress at this period in history.***

ARTHUR: Did you say ‘shrubberies’?

ROGER: Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name is Roger the Shrubber. I arrange, design, and sell
shrubberies.

BEDEVERE: [To ROGER] Ni!

ARTHUR: [To BEDEVERE] No! No, no, no! No!

Scene 24.*'—Arthur and the Knights of Ni, Take 2

[The scene is again the forest of the KNIGHTS OF NI. ARTHUR and BEDEVERE, et al. stand before them. A
shrubbery, complete with little white picket fence, stands between them.]

ARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery. May we go now?

HEAD KNIGHT OFNI: It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly. But there is one small problem.
ARTHUR: What is that?

HEAD KNIGHT: We are now.. .mo longer the Knights Who Say Ni.

OTHER KNIGHT OFNI: Ni!

HEAD KNIGHT: [To OTHER KNIGHT] Shh shh. [To ARTHUR] We are now the Knights Who Say Ecky-Ecky-Ecky-
Ecky-Pikang-Zoom-Boing-Gumzowehzeh....

OTHER KNIGHT OFNI: Ni.

HEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.

ARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of—[sigh] Knights Who ’Til Recently Said Ni?

HEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must Und...another shrubberyl
[dramatic musical sting]

ARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!

HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery—only
slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.

OTHER KNIGHTS OF NI: A path! A path! Ni!

HEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the
forest...wiiiith...a herring! [displays herring]

[dramatic musical sting]

ARTHUR: We shall do no such thing!

HEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please.

ARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can’t be done!

KNIGHTS OF NI: [greatly pained] Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!

HEAD KNIGHT: Don’t say that word!

ARTHUR: What word?

HEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell. Suffice it to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.

ARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don’t tell us what it is!

-

*0 In all likelihood, this is entirely true, and yet somehow moot.

I—I mean we—feel compelled to point out again that, while this scene obviously doesn’t contain the character referred to
in scene 29 as “the old man from scene 24,” neither does scene 24 in the (real) script of the film. That character instead
appears in (our) scene 16, (real) scene 14.

KNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!

ARTHUR: What, ‘is’?

HEAD KNIGHT: No, not ‘is’ We couldn’t get very far in life not saying ‘is’.

BEDEVERE: My liege, it’s Sir Robin!

ARTHUR: Surely you’ve not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?

MINSTREL: [singing] He is sneaking away and buggering up—

ROBIN: [to MINSTREL] Shut up! [to ARTHUR] No, no, no—far from it.

HEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again!

ROBIN: I was looking for it...

KNIGHTS OENI: Aaaaugh!

ROBIN: ...Uh, here, here in this forest.

ARTHUR: No, it is far from this —

KNIGHTS OENI: Aaaaugh!

Scene 24.5*^—King Brian the Wild

[28 EXTERIOR - DAY]


2s,-

In a dismal show of inconsistency, we find the word that the Knights of Ni cannot bear (‘it’) no fewer than six times
earlier in this scene and in the previous Knights of Ni scene (Scene 17) with no reaction from the Knights at aU. The Head
Knight himself is even heard to utter once or twice!

*3 In the (real) script, the Knights of Ni show up briefly again after this brief insert. They hear someone else coming and
discuss what they shall call themselves this time to get another shrubbery; they decide on “Knights who say Nicky Nicky.”
Before the animated set piece, the original script for the film included a drawn-out sub-plot about King Brian the Wild.
This piece contained several keen callbacks to earlier jokes, spectacular insanity, some gruesome cruelty, and an alternate
explanation of the demise of the minstrels. With some stern-minded revision, it might well have been a fine addition to
the movie, but in fact cut, probably for monetary and time considerations. We present the full text of it here for your
scholarly edification.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail


[A Small group of PEASANTS are being shuffled into a group formation, at the apparent direction of someone
behind the camera. A Few coughs as they shuffle together, a moment of silence, then they burst into pleasant
(mellifluous) song.]

When the trees do blossom full and all the hills are green
Oh! Oh! We sing hey! hey! We sing our count....ry Song...

[A hail of arrow hits them and they crumple up. Sound of raucous laughter OFF CAMERA.]

[CUT TO Reveal a firing squad of ARCHERS kneeling not ten feet away from the group of SINGERS.]

[Sitting on the throne on a dais is KING BRIAN THE WILD. He is roaring with laughter, and his court is slightly
shabby - bearing all the marks of a faded richness. It is a court without women, and nobody does the washing or
shaves very well. Perhaps there is washing however on the line over the castle. KING BRIAN’S ADVISERS stand
around him. Everyone bears the signs of past injuries (Except for BRIAN himself) I.E. they have an arm in a sling or
head bandaged; all the people at court, except for BRIAN have their left arm missing (possibly the result of some
violent edict a few years back)]

KING BRIAN: HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO! HA! HA! HA! HA! Oh! Very good! Next!

FIRST ADVISER: (a Little uncomfortably - perhaps his arm is in a sling obviously giving him some pain) There are no
more. Sir.

KING BRIAN: (grabbing him by the collar) What d’you mean, you filthy dog!

FIRST ADVISER: There are no more close harmony groups in the kingdom. Sir.

KING BRIAN: No more close harmony groups!!!

FIRST ADVISER: We have scoured the kingdom.

KING BRIAN: (lifting him bodily into the air and breaking his arm again slightly) You Miserable worm! You wretch!
You walking son of a dunghill keeper! Guards!

[Two Rather shabby looking GUARDS approach, (as everyone else they also have their left arms missing)]

FIRST ADVISER: have mercy your MAJESTY!

KING BRIAN: GUARDS! Take him away and suspend him by his nostrils from the highest tree in the kingdom!

[The Guards grab him unmercifully and drag him off. he whines piteously.]

[29 EXTERIOR - DAY]“

[CUT BACK to the glade where the KNIGHTS OF NI! were. A police car roars up. Two PLAINCLOTHES
DETECTIVE and a CONSTABLE get out, look around suspiciously, perhaps kneel and examine the ground. One
POLICEMAN finds PATSY’s shoe and the other finds a strange scientific instrument that was hanging from
BEDEVERE.]

[They nod grimly to each other. Climb back in the car and drive off]

[30 EXTERIOR - DAY]

[Back in KING BRIAN’S Court, the FIRST ADVISER has been dragged off there are muffled screams coming
from the nearby tree, the FIRST ADVISER is being hauled up it on pulleys.]

SECOND ADVISER: Your Majesty, I can Find you a Lute player, whose music is passing sweet.

KING BRIAN: It’s not the same. You thick-headed fool! (KING BRIAN hits him on the back of the head, he falls.)
There’s no fun in killing soloists!

SECOND ADVISER: (picking himself up) He may have a friend...

KING BRIAN: GUARDS!

SECOND ADVISER: Oh Please your majesty! Please!

KING BRIAN: Take him away and tie his kidneys to the longest hedge in the kingdom!

[The GUARDS drag the ADVISER roughly away.]

SECOND ADVISER: No! (he is dragged off screaming and protesting)

KING BRIAN: (roaring at the rest of the court) I will personally disembowel the next little bastard who tells me that
there are no more close harmony ...

[At this moment we hear faintly the sound of singing. KING BRIAN stopped to listen. The entire COURT turns
thankfully towards the mellifluous sounds.]

We’re the knights of the round table
our shows are formidable
but many times we’re given rhymes
that are quite unsingable...

KING BRIAN: Wait a minute! Eive point harmony with a counter-tenor lead!

[Various members of the COURT sigh and breathe more easily.]

CREEP: Thank goodness.

KING BRIAN: Shut up! (punches him right on the end of the nose and shouts to the SECOND ADVISER) Oy you!
SECOND ADVISER: (doubled-up, Surrounded by soldiers busy with his stomach) Yes, Your majesty?

KING BRIAN: Go and get ‘em!

SECOND ADVISER: (gratefully) Thank you sir! (He staggers off with some difficulty)

GUARD: ‘ere... We’d just started taking his kidneys out.

CUT TO ARTHUR, BEDEVERE, GALAHAD and LANCELOT. (Garwin,thrstam [sic], Hecrot [sic]“) plus all their
pages, there are riding along singing cheerily.

KNIGHTS: We’re baby mad and Camelot

we nurse and push the pram a lot
in war we’re tough and able
quite indefatigable
between our quests we sequin vests
and dress like Betty gable [sic]
it’s a...**’

SECOND ADVISER: HALT!

SIR GALAHAD: Who are you who dares to halt the knights of king Arthur’s round table in mid-verse?

SECOND ADVISER: I bring greetings from the court of king Brian.

SIR LANCELOT: King Brian the wild?

SECOND ADVISER: Some call him that, but he’s calmed down allot recently.

SIR GALAHAD: Are those YOUR kidneys?

SECOND ADVISER: (covering his stomach) No no... It’s nothing - just a flesh wound. (The KNIGHTS look at each
other) he has herd your beautiful melody; and wishes you to come to his court, that he may listen at his ease ooh!

SIR LANCELOT: You must be joking! (general murmur or agreement from the other KNIGHTS.) Go to the court of
king Brian the wild and sing close harmony!

OTHER KNIGHTS: No fear etc.

SECOND ADVISER: (in increasing pain) It need not be close harmony oooh agh!

SIR GALAHAD: Ah but it would get round to close harmony, wouldn’t it?

Who these people are and why their names are misspelled is a mystery. Maybe the writer died in middle of writing it.
‘Sic,’ by the way means ‘thus’ in Latin, indicating the text appears exactly as it appeared in the source, even if it looks like a
mistake.

Note how these lyrics differ from those earlier. The misspelling of Betty Grable’s name is in the original.

SECOND ADVISER: Not necessarily ... As I say king Brian is much more relaxed than he used to be.

SIR GALAHAD: I mean could we just stick to one line of plainsong with a bit of straight choral work?

SECOND ADVISER: Well obviously he’d prefer a bit of close harmony arghhh!

KNIGHTS: Ah! There you are!

SIR LAUNCELOT: We’d end unlike the Shalott Choral Society.

SECOND ADVISER: Oh that was an accident - honestly he’s so calm now oh!

ARTHUR: No we must be on our way.

[They start off.]

SECOND ADVISER: (by now lying on the ground at his last gasp but still trying to sound threatening) If you don’t
come and sing for him ... ah ... he’ll drive ... oh ... iron spikes though your heads.

KNIGHTS: Ah! That sounds more like Brian the wild!

SECOND ADVISER: (looking helplessly at his intestines) He ... he ... still gets irritable occasionally.

SIR GALAHAD: Like with close harmony groups.

SECOND ADVISER: Ooh ... Look if you’re scared ...

SIR LANCELOT: We’re not SCARED!

SECOND ADVISER: (With his last ounce of strength) Very well! King Brian challenges your to sing before him in
close harmony!

ARTHUR: A challenge?

The KNIGHTS look at each other rather taken aback but an idealistic glow suffuses KING ARTHUR’S eyes as he
looks heaven-wards. The other KNIGHTS look at him rather fearfully.

ARTHUR: (majestically) It is a challenge. We cannot refuse.

SIR GALAHAD: King Brian’s a fucking loony.

SECOND ADVISER: Great! (dies)

SIR GALAHAD: Are you all right?

[CUT TO KING BRIAN the wild on his dias {sic}, he sees the KNIGHTS enter the arena.]

KING BRIAN: Ah good!

[CUT TO TRUMPETERS who executes a rather bad fanfare full of missed notes, meanwhile various SHOTS of
preparation.]

KING BRIAN: settling down.

KNIGHTS being led up to the podium. The last of the previous close harmony group is being loaded onto a cart
and pushed away by the cart driver from scene tow (Perhaps we see him being paid off)

[SHOT of KING BRIAN on his podium and the HERALD being untied and having his gag removed.]

[SHOT of ARTHUR and KNIGHTS getting into a group on the podium still rather nervous. The fanfare comes to
an end, and several wrong notes.]

KING BRIAN: (who can’t wait) RIGHT! Carry on gentleman.

HERALD: KING BRIAN SAYS CARRY ON!

ARTHUR: (whispering) All right... two tenor lines - I’ll take the base.

[They all nod.]

One... Two... Three...

ONE-LEGGED RSM: Left... Left... Left, left, left, left Left... Left... Left, left, left, left.

KING BRIAN: Right! On the count of three ... one ...

HERALD: THE KING’S SAID ONE!

KING BRIAN: Two!

HERALD: THE KING’S SAID TWO! THEY’VE ONLY GOT ONE LEFT!

clearly pretty near.]

KING BRIAN: (face in a paroxysm of blood-lust) Three!

HERALD: THREE!

“Bravely, good sir robin was not at all afraid...’’

a few feet in from of the them looking rather embarrassed.]

“To have his eyeballs skewered and his kidneys ... argh!’’

KING BRIAN: HA! HA! HA! HA! HO! HO! HO! HO! Oh bloody marvelous!

Scene 25.—Sir Robin’s Minstrels Are Eaten

[In a little animated woods, we see the little animated ARTHUR and his KNIGHTS traipsing along as the
NARRATOR speaks.]

NARRATOR: And so Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the
old man had spoken in Scene 24. Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Gallahad, and there was much rejoicing.

ALL: Yea! Yea!

[An evil-looking animated wind-figure blows out the sun. Snow settles on the mountain. ARTHUR’S party
passes behind the mountain.]

NARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador they were forced to eat Robin’s minstrels. And there was much rejoicing.
ALL: [from behind mountain] Yea!

[Cut to hillock with tree in depths of winter. A SHEPHERD is huddled under a cloak near his two sheep.]
NARRATOR: A year passed. Winter changed into spring. [Snows fade, tree sprouts.]

SHEPHERD: [Throwing off cloak] Mmm. Nice.

NARRATOR: Spring changed into summer. [Tree is in full leaf SHEPHERD flops down for a nap] Summer changed
back into winter. [Snows fade in. SHEPHERD pokes head out of snow.] And winter gave spring and summer a miss

Ooh, naked social commentary! I bet the prime minister himself asked that the scene be cut just because of that line.

and went straight on into autumn. [Snows Me. Tree is in full leaf, then leaves, branches, and all fall and hit
SHEPHERD on the head.] Until one day...

Scene 26.—Arthur and His Knights Meet the Enchanter

[The scene is a rocky countryside, probably Scotland this time, given that we are about to meet an enchanter
with an abominable Scottish accent. ARTHUR and his KNIGHTS are making their way along the highland road. A
thunderous boom is heard.]

[KNIGHTS OE THE ROUND TABLE halt]

ARTHUR: Knights! Eorward! [They start again.]

[Cut to TIM atop an outcropping, throwing pyrotechnic spells at various rocky crags. The KNIGHTS halt.
Suddenly, TIM summons a ball of fire on the very spot he is standing. But he is gone! Just as suddenly,*^ TIM
reappears in a cloud of smoke just a few feet away from ARTHUR. He continues to toss a couple more fiery spells.*]

ARTHUR: [To TIM] What manner of man are you that can summon up fire without flint or tinder?

TIM: [Turning to ARTHUR] I...am an enchanter.

ARTHUR: By what name are you known?

TIM: There are some who call me...Tim?’*

ARTHUR: Greetings, Tim the Enchanter.

TIM: Greetings, King Arthur!

ARTHUR: You know my name?

TIM: I do. [Blows flames from his staff] You seek the Holy Grail!

ARTHUR: That A our quest. You know much that is hidden, O Tim.

TIM: Quite. [Shoots a rocket from his staff at a tree, which explodes]

[KNIGHTS OE THE ROUND TABLE applaud politely.]

ARTHUR: Yes, we’re—we’re looking for the Grail. Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.

KNIGHTS: It is, yes, yup, yes, yeah.

ARTHUR: And so we’re— we’re— we’re— we’re looking for it.

KNIGHTS: Yes we are. We are.

BEDEVERE: We have been for some time.

ROBIN: Ages.

ARTHUR: Uh, so, uh, anything you can do to, uh, to help, would be... very... helpful...

GALLAHAD: [Stepping forward impatiently] Look, can you tell us wh—

[TIM throws a fireball in front of him. He stumbles back, holding his leg.]

ARTHUR: Eine, um, I don’t want to waste anymore of your time, but, uh, I don’t suppose you could, uh, tell us
where we might find a, um— find a, uh— a, um— a uh—

TIM: A what...?

ARTHUR: A G—, a G—

TIM: AGmil?!

Or slighdy less suddenly, since we’ve just seen him disappear.

Python must have really forked over the bucks for this scene. Compared to every other scene, this is Star Wars.

Apparendy, we are supposed to imagine that he would say “Merlin,” but I think by this point we have aU given up hope
of seeing the plot parallel the tradidonal legend. Merlin should have entered the story right at the beginning, anyway. And
he should be entirely absent from the Grail Quest story, since he represents ancient Celtic druidic magic so completely
opposed to Medieval Christian belief The plot is so far off track by this time that the best we could really hope for is for
it to veer toward the legend enough that we could at least just get it in sight again.

ARTHUR: Yes, I think so.

KNIGHTS: Yes, that’s it. Yes.

TIM: Yes!

KNIGHTS: Oh, thank you, thank you, splendid, fine.

[TIM shoots fire from fingers at rocky slope]

ARTHUR: Look, you’re a busy man, uh...

TIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.

KNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.

TIM: To the north there lies a cave—the Cave of Caerbannog^^—wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very
living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged*^ [creates thunder] make plain the last resting place of the most
Holy Grail.

ARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?

TIM: Follow! [KNIGHTS begin to follow] But! [they halt] follow only if ye be men of valor, fo’ the entrance to this
cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel tha’ no man yet has fought with i’ and lived! Bones of full fifty men lie
strewn abou’ its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doub ’ your courage or your strength, come n’ further, for death
awaits you all with nasty big pointy teeth [makes universal pointy-teeth gesture].

ARTHUR: [To GALLAHAD] What an eccentric performance.

Scene 27.—Arthur and his Knights get t he ir Medieval Butts Kicked

[The scene is a ridge above a rocky gorge. TIM leads ARTHUR and his KNIGHTS along the ridge. With the
clopping of coconuts and a whinny or two from the porters, the party halts.]

KNIGHT: They’re nervous, sire.

ARTHUR: [To KNIGHT] Then we’d best leave them here and carry on on foot. [To KNIGHTS] Dis -mount!

[KNIGHTS pretend to dismount horses. They lean down to get a view of the cave within the gorge, where bones
and armor lie strewn about.]

TIM: Behold the cave of Caerbannog!

ARTHUR: Right! [To KNIGHTS] Keep me covered.

KNIGHT: What with?

ARTHUR: [To KNIGHT] Just keep me covered.

TIM: [pointing] Too late!

[dramatic chord]

ARTHUR: What?

TIM: [still pointing] There he is!

[Enter a snowy white rabbit, hopping out of the cave, among the bones.®'*]

ARTHUR: Where?

TIM: There!

ARTHUR: What, behind the rabbit?

introduced from southern Europe quite some time after the time this film is set (probably the 1200s). Look, it isn’t a big
point, but they could just as well have used a good old European hare and not had any problems—and a brown hare,
thank you, not some laboratory mutant albino like this one. Rabbits, by the way—even mean ones—do not eat human
beings.

Dynamite was not, of course, invented until the 19th century, when Alfred Nobel mixed up the first batch to make
mining easier and safer. He later used the profits to create a perpetual trust to fund the Nobel prizes. On a different
subject entirely, Gawain died, according to tradition, by the hand of Lancelot with BaUn’s cursed sword Arondight
(Gawain was Lancelot’s best friend, but they fought when Arthur and his knights went to retrieve Guenevere after
Lancelot saved her and took her away to France). Ector died in the final battle with Mordred and his knights. And Bors
never died; being one of the knights who completed the quest for the Grad, he was whisked away to Avalon with Percival
and Galahad. There I go again; sorry.

This whole affair could be cleared up rather quickly with a good old English longbow. Unfortunately, knights considered
such weapons beneath them, preferring to face their opponents in melee combat on horseback (which is why the English
yeomen of Heniy' V’s army annihdated an overwhelming force of French knights at the Battle of Agincourt [1415] and
changed the course of warfare forever). The stupid clods. It’s nice of Python to make note of it, though.

Now, I don’t want to be a nit-picking scholar like those blockheads who review Beowulf a thousand years after it was
written and bitch about quirks in the meter, but hand grenades really are a bit young to be found in medieval England.
That’s all I wdl say, except that Antioch was the capital of ancient Syria and the center of Christianity for hundreds of years.
Interestingly, a chalice consisting of a plain metal cup set in a protective carved silver goblet was dug up in the ruins of
ancient Antioch in 1910. Some claim this, the Chalice of Antioch, is the Holy Grail. You can even go to see it, if you like,
in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It’s right next to the giant Brazilian Indian penis-sheath collection
(source: World Book Engiclopedid).

Note no rabbits.

BROTHER: [reading] “And the Lord spake, saying, ‘First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to
three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shalt be three.
Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.
Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.”’'°®

MAYNARD: Amen.

ALL: Amen.

ARTHUR: Right! [pulls pin] One... two... five!

GALLAHAD: Three, sir!

ARTHUR: Three! [lobs grenade]

[The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sails into the vicious lepus’ cave and explodes. This instantly gets the
attention of the constables investigating the death of the FAMOUS HISTORIAN several scenes away, where they
have come upon the broken remains of the shrubbery in the woods of the KNIGHTS OF NI. They make their way
toward the gorge.]

Scene 28.—Arthur and his Knights in the Cave of Caerbannog

[The scene is the interior of a large natural cavern. ARTHUR and his party enter and look about for the carved
runes spoken of by TIM. Suddenly, they come upon some runes.*”*]

ARTHUR: [pointing] There! Look!

LAUNCELOT: [examining runes] What does it say?

GALLAHAD: What language is that?

ARTHUR: [To MAYNARD] Brother Maynard, you’re our scholar!

MAYNARD: It’s Aramaic!‘'*^

GALLAHAD: Of course! Joseph of Arimathea!

LAUNCELOT: Of course!

ARTHUR: What does it say?

MAYNARD: It reads, [reading] “Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea. ‘He who is valiant and
pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of Auuggggggh.’”

ARTHUR: What?

MAYNARD: [reading] “The Castle of Auuggggggh.’’

Okay, I win say a bit more. You see, Attila was never even heatijiedhy the Catholic Church, much less canonized (although
he did meet with Pope Leo I when he and his huns visited Rome {they had raged across Europe and now were going to
rape Mother Rome herself and loot her ancients treasures, but the pope persuaded Attila to go home [How he did this,
no one knows, but I’m willing to bet someboc^ was on their knees, and they weren’t prayin’]}). Also, there is no Book of
Armaments in any Christian bible, although there is a Book of Numbers, which, I believe, has something to do with
trinitular trigonometry, the religious study of the Three-in-One—a sort of holy book of logarithms. Oh, also, it’s funny
that the monk should mention breakfast cereals and Attila almost in the same breath. It is a documented fact that Attila
the Hun was the first person ever to go cuckoo for Coco Puffs® (source: A Book I Read A Long Time Ago).

These runes were apparently written by Joseph of Arimathea, the legendary' guardian of the Holy Grail, given into his care
by the apostles after the crucifixion, he having been the only man willing to offer Christ a tomb (stone tombs were quite
expensive back then—not that they’re any cheaper now days, but it really was considered the only way to go), but why the
apostles gave Joe the Holy Grail—the cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper—rather than, say the sandals He wore
last or a lock of His hair or something, I don’t know. I guess it goes back to that symbolism of sustenance I was
babbling about earlier, although it seems like history narrowly missed being filled with legends of the Holy Salad Fork.

'*>2 Aramaic was a Semitic language (and therefore related to Hebrew) used by the Aramaeans and later by others of
southwest Asia (including the Jews) first as a trade language and later as a daily language (source: World Book Encyclopedia).
It, rather than Greek or Latin, was probably the language spoken by Jesus and the Apostles.

BEDEVERE: What is that?

MAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.

LAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!

MAYNARD: [To LAUNCELOT] Well, that’s what it says.

ARTHUR: [To MAYNARD] Look, if he was dying, he wouldn’t bother to carve ‘auuggggh’. He’d just say it!

MAYNARD: [To ARTHUR] Well, that’s what’s carved in the rock!

GALLAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.

ARTHUR: [to GALLAHAD] Oh, shut up. [to MAYNARD] Well, does it say anything else?

MAYNARD: [looking again] No. Just,‘auuggggggh’.

LAUNCELOT: [To himself] Auugggh.

ARTHUR: [To himself] Aaauggh.

BEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camauuuugh?

GALLAHAD: [To BEDEVERE] Where’s that?

BEDEVERE: [To GALLAHAD] Erance, I think.

LAUNCELOT: Oh, you mean sort of a “Aah!”

BEDEVERE: Yes, but I—Aaaaagh!

GALLAHAD: Oooh! My God!

Beast chases them. '*’^]

The Camargue is indeed a beautiful wetland wildlife preserve in France.

lot At this point, the original (real) script includes a joke about a Sir Alf who, feeding bread to the Black Beast off-camera,
was eaten.

Wait! I just remembered why I went into that whole bit about Joseph of Arimathea. You see, the Knights came to the
cave of Caerbannog looking for runes detailing the last words of Olftn Bedwere ofRheged —but why Olfin Bedwere would
know of the last resting place of the Holy Grail is beyond me. And it’s really quite absurd to imagine that both Olfin
Bedwere and Joseph of Arimathea would know of the last resting place of the Grail and both come to the cave of
Caerbannog (who the hell is Caerbannog, anyway?) to carve it on the living rock and both die right there doing it.
Although it is logical that they should both die in the cave if they ever got there, seeing as how it is the lair not only of the
cruel and vicious rabbit (hey, maybe that’s who Caerbannog is) but also of the Black Beast of Auuggh—but why the two
hadn’t killed each other long before the Knights arrived we’ll never know. Maybe the two had a symbiotic relationship,
the rabbit—we’U call him Caerbannog until we find evidence against it—killing any who approached the cave, and the
Black Beast devouring them. That would explain the multitude of skeletal remains just outside the cave and yet the small
size of Caerbannog. Anyway, let’s get back to the action.

[The scene is the rim of the Gorge of Eternal Peril, where smoke and lava sounds rise out of the depths of the
gorge. ARTHUR, ROBIN, BEDEVERE, GALLAHAD, and LAUNCELOT skirt the rim, shuffling toward the rickety
rope-and-plank bridge. '“*]

ROBIN: Oh, I won’t go.

GALLAHAD: Who’s going to answer the questions?

ARTHUR: [To ROBIN] Sir Robin!

ROBIN: Yes?

ARTHUR: Brave Sir Robin, you go.

ROBIN: Hey! I’ve got a great idea. Why doesn’t Launcelot go?

LAUNCELOT: [coming forward] Yes, let me go, my liege. I shall take him single-handed, [gesturing] I shall make a

The original (real) script prefaced this scene with a callback to the signs in the three-headed giant scene. These signs read
“Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 5 miles,” and later one pointing the other way reads “Ni! 82 miles.”

And this thing really looks unsafe—I mean, I wouldn’t try to cross it, especially with a name like “Bridge of Death.” It’s
not hard to imagine how it got that name; probably hikers and Girl Guides falling off it all the time....

Of course, according to our count, he is the ‘old man from Scene 16.’

How Arthur knows all this is beyond me. I mean, he’s dumb as a stump before this, asking everybody questions about
eveiynhing, but all of a sudden, he’s Arthur the Pathfinder or something.

Scene 30.—Beyond the Bridge of Death

[The scene is the other side of the Bridge of Death, a bleak and foggy place, as are most places in English
legend. After all, when you live in a bleak and foggy land, it’s hard to even imagine, say, a sunny beach on the coast
of Mexico, where the water is so clear you can see all the way to the bottom, thirty or forty feet below. Anyway,
ARTHUR and BEDEVERE cross over the bridge and begin looking for LAUNCELOT.]

ARTHUR: Launcelot? Launcelot! Launcelot!

"2 I really feel compelled to mention again that, by all accounts, it was not Lancelot who completed the quest for the Holy
Grail. In English legend, it was Galahad, although, in French and German legend, it was Percival—there was even a
German opera written about Percival. For some reason, Lancelot—the greatest knight of all—never got his own opera.
Tristram did, but he doesn’t even appear in this film. But I’m not bitter. Really.

The (real) script originally had these questions being answered off camera while we watched Lancelot; this made the
surprise (death of the Old Man) play a bit differendy—more subde, but ultimately less effective.

Not to mention a capital bit of irony utilizing the Rule of Three a«</a precisely-timed callback to the opening scene of the
film, now a fully-formed running gag.

"5 This intermission shamelessly pirates the intermission of the Beatles’ Help! oi 1965. Actually, much of Python’s humor
pirates that of the Beatles—except that the Beaties didn’t dress in women’s clothing and they had rather better songs.
Further Python/Beatie parallels can be found in Eric Idle’s (and others) The Rutles, 1979. Okay, so maybe both the
Beaties and Monty Python owe tribute to English dance hall burlesque, but still...the Beaties filmed it first.

which point Arthur and Bedevere dump him into the water and steal his boat; a priceless callback that got cut.

This must be the castle of the Fisher King (out of the French Arthurian cycles), where the Grail was kept and guarded.
The Fisher King’s castle has the distinct advantage, as far as fortification goes, of lying outside the realm of space and time.
It appears and disappears as necessary' (quite to the consternation of Percival, who is most closely associated with it)
wherever necessary. Bahn the Sauvage (remember him?) was the only knight in Malory’s version that discovered the
castle—and he only by accident long before the quest for the Grail was begun. It was he, in fact, who wounded the
Wounded King (he really was as wild as his name suggests), and using nothing less than the Spear of Longinus (the
legendary' Roman soldier who pierced Christ’s side while He hung on the cross)! This may be the whole reason why the
quest had to be undertaken in the first place, spiritually speaking. Ahhh, isn’t literature fun?

How did the French Guard get across the Bridge of Death, which, until Launcelot, “no man” had ever crossed? Anyway,
in the original (real) script, the French Guard also says, “We French persons outwit you a second time, perfidious English
mousedropping hoarders! How you say: “Begorrah!”

Troyes. Therefore, the subsequent arrival of the French castle guard seen earlier elsewhere, who claimed his lord already had a
Grail, should be no surprise. Guy de Loimbard does have a Grail, he is the Fisher King, appearing and disappearing as
necessary! He is the guardian of the Holy Grail, defending it against the English heretics who would deny the Holy
Roman Church and set up their own Church of England! It all makes sense! It finally all makes sense after all!! This is
genius!! Pure genius!!!

120 Well, the drums don’t actually roll, of course; I just mean that a drum roll is played on the snare drums. Of course,
maybe it would be just as well if the drums did roll. I mean, everynhing else has gone to heU. Where did these soldiers
come from? How did Arthur and Bedevere get across the lake? How do they imagine they wiU attack back across the lake?
Aaaaauuuuuugggghhh!

121 The (real) script calls them ‘black maiias.’

122 Wait. Wait a minute. Arthur’s right. God himself did choose him earlier in the film to retrieve the Grail. That sort of
kills things. Maybe they haven’t proven themselves worthy or something. That must be it; Arthur failed somewhere
along the line. But where? The shrubberies? The cave? The bridge? Perhaps it was in ‘allowing’ the historian to die;
‘warping history’ as it were. Of course, Arthur isn’t supposed to achieve the Grail anyway, according to all the legends—he
wasn’t remotely worthy. Everyone who was in the running has been lost or killed off. Hmm.

122 Say, maybe this ending is a comment on the bankrupt nature of British society in the middle ’70s. Maybe Python is
trying to say that British society had forsaken the principles and ideals that had made it such a great empire. When THG
was made. Great Britain was stiU suffering the effects of World War II, in which “mighty” Britain required the gracious aid
of America to fend off the Nazi war machine. Britain’s coinage no longer carried IND IMP (the Latin abbreviation for
‘Emperor [or Empress] of India’), a daily reminder of the loss of India and other territories that made Britain an empire.
King George VI had died and been replaced by his daughter Elizabeth in 1952—and this after the heir-apparent Edward
had abdicated to George so he could marry a divorced American woman (and become Duke of Windsor). That, perhaps
more than anything else, produced a certain feeling that those magnificent coronation ceremonies—watched on television
by millions around the world—was the last gasp of the British monarchy. That institution, more than a thousand years
old, was finally reduced to litde more than figurehead status, mere ghostly echoes of “Pomp and Circumstance.” The
hope that, one day, the Once and Future King prophesied so long ago would at last return to rule the kingdom was
insubstantial. Faith was lost. The Holy Grail was a hollow dream—an empty cup. More likely, though. Python just ran
out of money. They couldn’t even afford a nice big “THE END” in the final frames.

(AA is 14 and over, and A is 5-14).[sic]

For an ‘A’ we would have to:

• Lose as may ‘shits’ as possible

• Take ‘Jesus Christ’ out, if possible

• Loose [sic] “I fart in your general direction”

• Lose “the oral sex”

• Lose “oh, fuck off’ [replaced with “get stuffed”]

• Lose “We make castanets out of your testicles”

I would like to get back to the Censor and agree to lose the ‘shits,’ take the odd ‘Jesus Christ’ out and
lose ‘Oh fuck off,’ but to retain ‘fart in your general direction’, ‘castanets of your testicles’ and ‘oral sex’
and ask him for an ‘A’ rating on that basis. Please let me know as soon as possible your attitude to this.
